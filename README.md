# Quantum Chemistry Cpp

## Introduction


## Purpose
It was around 2018 when I first started writing quantum chemistry programs. I was lucky enough to find a great tutorial from [Crawford Group](https://crawford.chem.vt.edu/) as well as an easy to understand book. 



## Prerequisites
* Quantum Chemistry, it is best to have taken a relevant course or read a book on this subject.
* C++ programming experience (500-1000 lines of code) and basic data structures.

## Feedback
* Ask a question where you don't understand
* Spot incorrect or incomprehensible expressions
* Submit bugs and improve the quality of code
* Make a suggestion for improving the document

In any of the above situations, you can contact me via [email](mailto:rudin.jiang@gmail.com). I would greatly appreciate receiving any suggestions that readers may have for improving the document.
