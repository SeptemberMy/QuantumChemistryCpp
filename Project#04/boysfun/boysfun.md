# Boys Function

Boys function $F_n(x)$ plays an important role in in the evaluation of molecular integrals over Gaussian functions. The Boys function is defined by

$$
F_n(x) = \int_{0}^{1} t^{2n} \exp(-xt^2) \, {\rm d} t
$$

This article will discuss some properties and implementations of this function.
