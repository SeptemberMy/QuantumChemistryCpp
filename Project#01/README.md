# Project #01: Something about C++ Programming

If you are new to C++, the following book will be a good textbook.
- [*C++ Primer (5th Edition)*. Stanley B. Lippman, et al. Addison-Wesley, 2013.](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113)

If you already master the syntax of C++ and you write high-quality C++ code, the following books will help you.
- [*Effective C++ (3rd Edition)*. Scott Meyers. Addison-Wesley, 2017](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876)
- [*More effective C++*. Scott Meyers. Addison-Wesley, 2014](https://www.amazon.com/More-Effective-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/020163371X)

## Designing Class Vec3d

In quantum chemistry programs, it is often necessary to define a data type to represent a point in three-dimensional space. In C++ programs, we generally define a class to represent a point.

## Namespace





## Building with CMake

if we want to compile a simple program with a single source file `source.cpp` , we can directly compile it by calling the compiler.

```shell
g++ -o prog source.cpp
```

But when we try to build a large program, things get complicated. 



## Unit Testing

Bugs in the program are inevitable. [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is an extremely effective means of troubleshooting bugs. We will add unit tests to our program so that we will have some confidence in the correctness of the program we have written.

[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) a mature C++ unit testing framework, and it is our choice. Below we will briefly describe how to use GoogleTest for unit testing.

Create a new folder called `extern` in the root of our project to hold third-party dependencies. Go into the `extern` folder and clone GoogleTest here.

```shell
mkdir extern
cd extern
git clone git@github.com:google/googletest.git --depth=1

# The effect of "--depth=1"
#    clone the latest committed. File size will be small
```

    for (double x = -10.0; x <= 10.0; x += 0.1){
    for (double y = -10.0; y <= 10.0; y += 0.1){
    for (double z = -10.0; z <= 10.0; z += 0.1){
        nhfMath::Vec3d v(x, y, z);
        EXPECT_NEAR(v.x, x, absErr);
        EXPECT_NEAR(v.y, y, absErr);
        EXPECT_NEAR(v.z, z, absErr);
    }}}
}
